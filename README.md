## Task

As a coding boot camp student, I wanted to make a quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stored high scores. This way I can gauge my progress compared to my peers.

## The Application

To accomplish this task, I've created an application using mainly Javascript that administers a quiz to the user. The application works as follows:

* When the user clicks the start button, a timer starts and they are presented with the first question.

* When they answer the first question they are presented with another.

* If they get a question wrong, 5 seconds is subtracted from the timer.

* When all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, the game is over and the user is prompted to save their initials and score.

* The initials and scores are stored locally and are shown in the high score page.
